Implementation of value iteration, policy iteration and Q learning algorithms that search for the optimal
policy. The game is a simple deterministic implementation of an OpenAI gym environment extended to Markov
Decision Process.

__How to play__: Type `L` to move left or `R` to move right and have fun :)
