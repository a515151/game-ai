## Sheriff Chase - [`sheriff/`](sheriff/)

Implementation of value iteration and policy iteration reinforcement learning algorithms that search for the optimal
policy. The game is a simple deterministic implementation of an abstract Markov Decision Process interface.

__How to play__: Type `L` to move left or `R` to move right and hit enter. It's stupid and not a lot of fun :)

__Details__: [Markov Decision Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process)
